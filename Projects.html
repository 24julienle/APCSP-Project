    <p class="p">I search: This project was for freshman year English 1-2. It was a series of essays inclulding a proposal, broad media search, interview, book review, and specific media search. It entailed researching, reading, and writing. The topic I chose was exercise's effects on mental health. This was meaningful to me because I enjoy athletics but I also care about mental well being. </p>

    <p class="p">Create performance task: This project was for sophmore year AP Computer Science Principles. It including a coding section in Javascript, a video section showing the code running, and a write-up section about the code. My code was a database of people on my track team, where the user could search for someone and it would give them their statistics. This was an  important project for me because it required problem solving skills and I ended up creating something useful and interesting for me.</p>
