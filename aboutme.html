    <p class="p">Hi, I'm Julien Lee. I am 15 years old and I am a sophomore at Piedmont High School. In my free time, I enjoy running, reading and watching basketball. I live at home in Piedmont with my parents, two brothers, two cats, and turtle. I have always loved math because it's both logical and beautiful. I also enjoy English and Art classes. I have been drawing since a very young age in the footsteps of my mother, who was a graphic designer. I also love ice cream! </p>
